There I had an amazing pourover and watched the storms go by as I charged my phone and caught up with friends via text. I also caught up on the Mariners win streak - fourteen games as of the time of writing. Outside the coffee shop, an older lady gave me a brief history of Bowling Green’s main street. She also told me to hug someone and that smiles were hugs. We both complained about the loud cars passing by, interrupting our conversation. Inside, I met someone who had come to Bowling Green by walking all the way from Pittsburgh. He was fun to chat with and wished me well for the rest of my trip.",
