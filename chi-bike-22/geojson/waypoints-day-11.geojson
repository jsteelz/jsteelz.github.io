We talked over grapes while the burgers were grilling. He is a recently retired widower of ten years who loves fishing and boating of all kinds. He was eager to show me his catches for the day - lots of fish indeed. He was very kind to me and offered lots of food, most of which I declined as I was quite full from the pancake house meal. He eventually asked to see my bike, which I decided was the opportunity for me to head back to my tent. He said grace before we ate and had conservative talk radio as a perennial background - not my cup of tea.",
