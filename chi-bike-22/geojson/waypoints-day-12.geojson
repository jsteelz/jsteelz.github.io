I learned that corned beef hash isn’t really my thing. The French toast was pretty good. Their placemats featured intentionally misspelled local ads. Some locals said hi and wished me well on my trip."

A chipper man occupying the front desk immediately understood my situation and brought me back to the kitchen, where I filled my water bottle and got another. It turns out that this man is on the board of the region’s cycleway council and so he offered route planning advice and gave me a biking map of the region. His kindness and the encounter left me awestruck and illuminated my day immensely. I intend on keeping the map for a while. Upon exiting the town a resident’s lawn had a sign saying “We love our local public library” and I could only agree."
