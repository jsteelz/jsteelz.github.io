There was a ghastly, overpowering quantity of mayo slathered all over it, so I threw the back half of it out and felt bad about it for the rest of the day. During my caffeination there, I watched as an incredible number of ATVs rolled into the adjoining gas station, and watched the coming and going of passersby as I charged my phone. I had Cowboy Take Me Away going through my head all day after it came on the radio at the Town Line Market."

However, I was incredibly early, so after enjoying a fruit cup from the Price Chopper and an accidentally “Diet” Arnold Palmer and Cool Ranch Doritos from Stewart’s, I made my way to the Dunkin, got a maple donut, and evaluated my options with the help of the wall charger next to me. I looked for campsites or campgrounds along my route, finding only two realistic options, both of which did not return my calls. So I looked further, realizing that Watertown was only 60 kilometres away and featured a litany of midrange hotel options. I eventually settled on this option, got another water bottle, and hit the road."
