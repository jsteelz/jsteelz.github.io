The company was quite something. As I walked into the namesake shack with my meal I quickly understood my outcast status, as the local crowd of 11am daydrinkers and potty-mouths shot me a telling glance. Undeterred, I claimed a spot in a peculiarly comfortable bar chair by a blown-out window doing an excellent job of siphoning the barbecue’s copious particulate matter directly into my lungs.",
