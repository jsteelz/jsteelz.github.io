Zeke (the man who had invited me over the night before) was very into outdoorsy things - his daughter was slightly weary every time he mentioned another camping product to me. Zeke told me that he lived right by but was camping here to host a small family reunion - his daughter and granddaughter, Julianna, live down in the Tampa area. Zeke made me coffee, bacon, and eggs, as I discussed the expanse of the crazy cross-bay bridges around Tampa with Yuli. It eventually became time to leave and I thanked the family and got on my way."
